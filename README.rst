AlphaPy
=======

**AlphaPy** is a machine learning framework for both speculators and
data scientists. It is written in Python with the ``scikit-learn``
and ``pandas`` libraries, as well as many other helpful libraries
for feature engineering and visualization. Here are just some of the
things you can do with AlphaPy:

* Run machine learning models using ``scikit-learn`` and ``xgboost``.
* Create models for analyzing the markets with *MarketFlow*.
* Predict sporting events with *SportFlow*.
* Develop trading systems and analyze portfolios using *MarketFlow*
  and Quantopian's ``pyfolio``.
